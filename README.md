# In this repository, I record all of my data modeling related projects that I did during my studies at UC Berkeley.

## SeaTurtle_Hatch_Rate_Prediction

In this project, my team and I devised several prediction models that would predict the Hatch rate of Sea Turtles in 
Cumberland Island based on environmental factors and relocation assistance. Full details are shown in the Sea Turtle Prediction files. 

## Project Wine

My team and I were comparing various linear regression models such as OLS, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic Net used to relate wine quality to different features of wine. Each model were fine-tuned using cross-validation.
