# Data Modeling Projects

I have done these data modeling projects while taking courses at UC Berkeley. Most of these projects were final projects and were worth a lot of points. Each project achieved an understanding of why each model were used, how they were used, and what results came from these models. It also achieved a deeper understanding behind the subject I (or my team and I) was modeling on. 

## SeaTurtle Hatch Rate Prediction Project

In this project, my team and I devised several prediction models that would predict the Hatch rate of Sea Turtles in 
Cumberland Island based on environmental factors and relocation assistance. Full details are shown in the Sea Turtle Prediction files. 

## Project Wine

My team and I were comparing various linear regression models such as OLS, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic Net used to relate wine quality to different features of wine. Each model were fine-tuned using cross-validation. 

## League of Legend Win Rate Prediction Project

My team and I's goal was to be able to predict the win rate of a team based on their draft picks. We took in stats about each character picked in a team and formulated a model that will provide the win rate. I tested several different unsupervised models such as Neural Network, KNN, and Random Forest. We found that Neural Network provided the best accuracy and improved significantly once player stats were included in the model.

## The Data, Inference, and Decisions Project

My team and I attempt to answer two research questions:
1. How does weather affects electricity consumption?
2. Can we predict the electricity consumption in a region given the regionâ€™s economic indicators?

The first question was investigated using a causual inference method, propensity scores, which helped address confounding variables such as seasonality. The second question was answered using General Linear Modeling and a ransom forest regressor model. Full detail and results are shown in Final_Paper.pdf.

## Data Engineering Projects

1. Movie Analysis SQL Project: In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis on movie and actor data using SQL (PostgreSQL). 
2. Baseball Database Query Performance Project: I compared different queries that achieved the same goal but had different execution times. In the end I learned which and why methods allow for speedy query performance based on the given data. This was also done in SQL (PostgreSQL).
3. Sensor Data Transformation Project: I applied advanced SQL transformation on sensor data to handle outliers and missing data. 
4. Yelp NoSQL Project: I explored how different database systems such as PostgreSQL (SQL) and MongoDB (MQL) handled semi-structured JSON data.
