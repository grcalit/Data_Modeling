# Data Modeling Projects

I have done these data modeling projects while taking courses at UC Berkeley. Most of these projects were final projects and were worth a lot of points. Each project achieved an understanding of why each model were used, how they were used, and what results came from these models. It also achieved a deeper understanding behind the subject I (or my team and I) was modeling on. 

## SeaTurtle Hatch Rate Prediction Project

In this project, my team and I devised several prediction models that would predict the Hatch rate of Sea Turtles in 
Cumberland Island based on environmental factors and relocation assistance. Full details are shown in the Sea Turtle Prediction files. 

## Project Wine

My team and I were comparing various linear regression models such as OLS, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic Net used to relate wine quality to different features of wine. Each model were fine-tuned using cross-validation. 

## League of Legend Win Rate Prediction Project

My team and I's goal was to be able to predict the win rate of a team based on their draft picks. We took in stats about each character picked in a team and formulated a model that will provide the win rate. I tested several different unsupervised models such as Neural Network, KNN, and Random Forest. We found that Neural Network provided the best accuracy and improved significantly once player stats were included in the model.
